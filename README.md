# PCNNSimulation
This is a project that simalates a pulse-coupled neuron network. 
Essentially it has two general methods parts: NeuronTest.main() and PulseNetTest.main().
First one shows a GUI allowing the observation of most important pulse neuron's properties (input, output and threshold) dynamics.
Second one takes a picture as an input and shows a dynamic responce of PCNN given that image.
